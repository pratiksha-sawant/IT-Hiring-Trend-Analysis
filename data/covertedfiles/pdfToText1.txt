Technology Glossary for Recruiters  //  2

Introduction

The plain truth is this: the tech 
world changes fast. As a recruiter 
competing for the best possible 
talent, how do you manage to stay 
on top of all the different types of 
tech roles, programming languages, 
and which tech roles require which 
language?

Recruiters oftentimes are 
salespeople at heart and have 
inarguable relationship development 
skills. However, they may lack a 
degree of technical knowledge that 
could help them better perform as 
tech recruiters. This is why we’ve 
developed this tech glossary. Now, 
recruiters of any level of expertise in 
any industry will be able to have a 
solid starting point in the tech world. 
This guide will help you understand:

∙ Popular Tech Roles: what 

they’re called and what they do

∙ Programming Languages 

and Technical Skills: 
definitions with a brief 
description of each

∙ Which Tech Roles Require 
Which Skills: stop wondering 
and start searching with greater 
efficiency

In a tight tech talent market, this 
glossary can help you communicate 
more effectively with your clients 
and the teams that you’re recruiting 
for, as well as with potential 
candidates. The words you learn 
in this glossary may seem like just 
a few simple terms, but they can 
empower you to talk to developers 
in their own language and fill high-
demand roles with top-notch talent 
faster than ever.

Popular 
Tech-
Related 
Roles

If one of your hiring managers 
came to you and said, “I need a 
mobile developer,” where would 
you begin your search? As the 
way we communicate continues to 
evolve, so do tech-related roles. For 
example, today’s mobile developer 
might only need to be proficient 
in iOS and Android platforms, but 
if the Windows phone catches on, 
there’s a new and growing niche in 
the mobile development field.

This section of our tech glossary 
gives you a list of today’s most 
common tech-related roles - the 
ones you’ll likely be tasked with 
filling. We’ll offer a brief overview of 
each role’s function (though it will 
vary by company and circumstance), 
and then a list of the most in-
demand programming languages 
and skills in today’s tech landscape. 
Finally, we’ll match those roles with 
the programming and development 
skills most commonly required. 
You’ll have everything you need to 
better understand tech roles, each 
role’s key technical skills, and how 
these match up with your recruiting 
efforts.

Which 
Tech Roles 
Require 
Which Skills

This is where the rubber meets the 
road. We’ve given you an overview 
of the most common tech roles in 
today’s market. We followed those 
roles with a primer in programming 
and development languages. In this 
section, we’ll show you the match-
up between the most common tech 
roles and the skills each might 
require.

We’ve tried to be as comprehensive 
as possible in including all of the 
skills each role might demand. We 
recommend having a conversation 
with your hiring manager or the 
technical team lead prior to starting 
the recruiting process so you know 
exactly which skills are needed for 
a given job. An idea: you can print 
out the page of this glossary with 
the tech role you’re going to recruit 
for and share it with the hiring 
manager. Ask the hiring manager 
to circle the skills/languages that 
are most important, if there’s any 
doubt. It’s one small extra step, but 
it can save you time when you need 
to target candidates with specific 
skill sets.
